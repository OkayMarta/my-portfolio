Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio website. This project was developed as a part of a **Web-Development** course on _Udemy_. It serves as an interactive digital resume where I showcase my skills, education, and pet projects.

## 📖 About The Project

This is a responsive, single-page Landing Page built with modern web development standards. The main goal of this project was to master **Semantic HTML5**, **SCSS (SASS)**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, and the **BEM methodology**.

The website features a clean design, smooth animations, and a fully adaptive layout that works on devices of all sizes—from mobile phones to desktop screens.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Fully Responsive:** Adaptive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure a seamless experience on any device.
- **Modular SCSS:** Styles are organized using the **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology for maintainability and scalability.
- **Interactive UI:**
    - Custom Hamburger Menu with smooth transitions.
    - Dynamic Sidepanel that changes color based on scroll position.
    - Animated Skill Progress Bars powered by JavaScript.
- **SEO Optimized:** Semantic tags, proper meta tags, and Open Graph data for social media sharing.
- **Modern Build Tooling:** Powered by **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds.
